Extracting information from Websites - we prefer API to access their data in a more structured manner.
focuses on the transformation of unstructured data (HTML format) on the web into structured data (database or spreadsheet).

Eg. - last week we were thinking of creating an index of hotness and sentiment about various data science courses available on internet. 
This would not only require finding out new courses, but also scrape the web for their reviews and then summarizing them in a few metrics.


If you can get what you need through an API, it is almost always preferred approach over web scrapping. 
This is because if you are getting access to structured data from the provider, 
why would you want to create an engine to extract the same information.
